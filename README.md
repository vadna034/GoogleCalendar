## Google Calendar Schedule Generator

# What is it? 

Well, it's my first project using JavaScript. More importantly, it can be used to create a CSV that can be easily imported
into your Google calendar profile in a fraction of the time it takes to make the CSV manually. 

# Why should I use it?

More time? Need I say more. 

# How can I use it? 

Simply check the days which you have the class, enter the name you want to display, as well as the start and end times. 
It's all quite intuitive. Then use the Generate CSV button to generate the CSV. 

In order to use the CSV, go onto your Google Calendar, and enter the Settings tab. Select import from teh import & export tab.
Then just add the CSV file and choose to import.
